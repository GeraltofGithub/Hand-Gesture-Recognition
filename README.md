# Hand-Gesture-Recognition
Simple Hand Gesture Recognition Project using Python OpenCV, Mediapipe and Tensorflow.
/
/
--Gesture recognition is an active research field in Human-Computer Interaction technology. It has many applications in virtual environment control and sign language translation, robot control, or music creation. In this machine learning project on Hand Gesture Recognition, we are going to make a real-time Hand Gesture Recognizer using the MediaPipe framework and Tensorflow in OpenCV and Python.
/
/
--Following are the prerequisites for this project
/
1. Python – 3.x (we used Python 3.8.8 in this project)
2. OpenCV – 4.5
Run “pip install opencv-python” to install OpenCV.
3. MediaPipe – 0.8.5
Run “pip install mediapipe” to install MediaPipe.
4. Tensorflow – 2.5.0
Run “pip install tensorflow” to install the tensorflow module.
5. Numpy – 1.19.3
/
/
--Steps to solve the project:
/
/
1.Import necessary packages.
2.Initialize models.
3.Read frames from a webcam.
4.Detect hand keypoints.
5.Recognize hand gestures.
